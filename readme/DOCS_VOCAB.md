🔹 1. General Principles

Use active voice: “Calculates the average” instead of “Average is calculated.”

Be concise: One line for @brief, longer explanation only if needed.

Avoid slang/ambiguous words: e.g., “stuff,” “thing,” “helper thingy” → instead, “module,” “handler,” “utility.”

Consistent terminology: Use the same word for the same concept across the project.
